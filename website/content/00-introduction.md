## Before we begin

Ream 5 is in early development, use it at your own risk. If you get stuck, reach for help in the GitHub issues.

## What is Ream?

Ream is a framework for building web apps in Vue.js, it's capable of making:

- Single-page app
- Server-rendered app
- Static app

## Why the name?

I'm an anime fan, and Ream stands for Rem & Ram.

## Getting started

Ream is not _YET_ available on npm, you need to build it from source for now:

```bash
# Fork it first
git clone git@github.com:user_name/ream.git
cd ream
yarn

# Build Ream and watch for changes
yarn workspace ream watch
# Preview Ream website locally
yarn workspace website dev
```
